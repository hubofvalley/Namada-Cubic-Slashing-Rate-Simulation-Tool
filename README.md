# Cubic Slashing Rate Simulation Tool

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Cubic Slashing Rate Simulation Tool by Grand Valley.

## Purpose of This Tool
This tool helps stakers understand Namada's unique Cubic Slashing system, which penalizes validators based on their voting power. It helps you assess risks, rewards, and encourages decentralized staking by spreading your stake across smaller validators.

## How Does Namada Slashing Work?
1. Think of slashing as a penalty: the more marbles (stake) a validator controls, the harsher the penalty if they misbehave.
2. When misbehavior happens, the validator is frozen – no one can withdraw their marbles until it's resolved.
3. The penalty increases if the validator controls more marbles, encouraging fair play.
4. The penalty is delayed, giving others time to react and protect their stake.
5. Validators can return after proving they’re ready to follow the rules again.

## Why Stake with Small Validators?
1. Think of a big jar: if it falls, everyone loses more. Spread your stake across many jars (smaller validators).
2. Spreading your marbles across jars protects your investment and strengthens the network.
3. Decentralization keeps the network secure and balanced.
4. Supporting smaller validators like Grand Valley promotes stability for Namada (tnam1qyplu8gruqmmvwp7x7kd92m6x4xpyce265fa05r6).
5. Don’t put all your marbles in one jar – spread them for safety!
